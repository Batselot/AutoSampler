# AutoSampler
This project is far from done, however we got some results from it. The main aim of this project is to control a stepper motor using a python interface. The part on arduino is far from complete so I refrain from downloading the file. 
However, I plan to update it on the following days.
The following were successfully completed with this project: 
1- A python interface that could communicate from serial with arduino was completed.
2- Arduino code that  moves the steppers according to the data received from python. 
3- The blue circles glow up as red when the mouse hovers over them.
4- The list of each circle's object number and their coordinates are extracted. They are later put onto a list to send over to arduino.

There are some missing parts on the project which I plan to update as soon as possible.

1- The Arduino collects data correctly. There are some issues with the motors that were worked on so the code was not tested. The complete .ino file is expected to be uploaded in a few days.
2- The mulitprocessing of the tkinter so that it would not freeze when the buttons are clicked. ( This was tested, but got some errors during the process.)

That's it. This is a project I started out as a hobby and I plan to complete it as soon as I can.
